If group viewing is the theme for your home theater, the two front speakers and center channel speakers should all be in a parallel line with the front row of seats.

The front left and right speakers need to enclose a 45 (for movies) to 60 (for music) degree angle with the center viewing position to truly give you the sound quality you seek. These are sold together as one unit and include all wiring.
