Winterizing Your Aboveground Swimming Pool Wohomen From wohomen.com
Unless you live in a warm area or an region where your pool water will not freeze during the winter months, we recommend always using a winter closing plate and winterizing return plug.

In the weeks leading up to the closing of your above ground pool, make sure that you keep your pool as chemically balanced as possible.
