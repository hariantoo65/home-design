What Is the Cost to Paint Kitchen by Keith From medium.com
Labor cost to paint cabinets. �the average cost of painting kitchen cabinets is $100 per drawer face and $175 per cabinet door,� he says. However, some cabinet painters may set their prices based on the total linear feet or square footage of cabinets that need to be painted. Based on an average cost of $25 for interior latex paint, and a total potential coverage of 400 square feet, it costs approximately $0.10 to paint 1 square foot of your kitchen cabinets, excluding labor and other related costs.
