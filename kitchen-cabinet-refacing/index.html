10 Kitchen Refacing Ideas A Creative Mom From unemamancreative.com
Refacing your kitchen cabinets is an alternative to replacing them that costs about half as much. The hardware—the hinges, handles, and drawer pulls—are usually also replaced during refacing. Cabinet refacing is essentially a replacement of the cabinet skins—removing the doors and drawer fronts and applying a new veneer over the existing surface of the body (carcass) of the cabinets. Your kitchen layout stays the same and the existing cabinets remain in place, so you can avoid a major renovation while still getting a noticeable return on investment.
